## About Me

I began as a NEET aspirant chasing medicine, but my father's push toward tech changed everything. His belief helped me discover my real passion — building, creating, and solving through code. Now, I craft full-stack apps, AI tools, and 3D web experiences, blending creativity with technology to bring ideas to life ✧
